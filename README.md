# To install

## Linux (Ubuntu)

Note that we're copying the files that were in the repo, but not overwriting the whole folder. This is because this folder has other files like LLM histories and those aren't versioned on Github (but they are still needed bu Cursor, apparently)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:queirozfcom/cursor-config.git /tmp/cursor-stuff && mv /tmp/cursor-stuff/*  ~/.config/Cursor/User/
```

## MacOS

`TODO`
